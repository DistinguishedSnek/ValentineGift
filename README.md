# ValentineGift
 A gift for my gf for valentine, my first ever game

TODO:
	Tadpole functionality (Half done, snacks)
		Fix Invalid access to property or key '_on_snack_eaten' on a base object of type 'previously freed'.
	Replace enemies

Perhaps: 
	Add multiple tadpoles following
	Add deaths for all kids
